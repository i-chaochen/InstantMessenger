My instant messenger project when I did my final year as an underground student.

Client 
* A login interface with RSA encryption algorithm;
* A friend List indicates online/offline friends;
* A chat window to send/receive text message to other friends, and text messages are encrypted by RSA encryption algorithm;

Server
* Server supports client's login verification, login/logout notification and message transmission.
* Distributed servers enhance the availability, even one of servers is terminiated, the Instant Messenger system is still working without any affect.
